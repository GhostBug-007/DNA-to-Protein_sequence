# DNA-to-Protein_sequence
This repository contains the code to covert DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence and also determines the polar nature of certain proteins
1. To run the program download all the containing files
2. Unzip the File which contains the DNA sequence
3. Keep all the files at the same location else do specify the path in the code (ELS.py)
4. Run the python3 file 
5. The output will be saved in a new file in the same location which will contain the protein sequence
